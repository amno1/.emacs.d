;;; Commentary:

;; A prime number is any integer greater than one which has no exact
;; integer divisors other than one and itself.
;;
;; Prime numbers have increasingly important practical applications
;; in cryptography, and are also useful in hashing, besides being of
;; fundamental importance in number theory.
;;
;; This is a small collection of functions for:
;;
;;	* testing integers for primality,
;;	* generating nearby primes,
;;	* finding the n-th prime,
;;	* generating lists of primes in a given range,
;;	* factoring a number into a product of primes,
;;	* finding the greatest common divisor of two numbers, and
;;	* finding the least common multiple of two numbers.
;;
;; The functions provided are:
;;
;;	(gcd n m)			[cost: O((12(ln 2)/pi^2)ln n)]
;;	(lcm n m)			[cost: O((12(ln 2)/pi^2)ln n)]
;;	(next-prime n)			[cost: O(sqrt(N))]
;;	(nth-prime n)			[cost: O(N*sqrt(N))]
;;	(prev-prime n)			[cost: O(sqrt(N))]
;;	(prime-factors n)		[cost: O(N)]
;;	(prime-p n)			[cost: O(sqrt(N))]
;;	(primes-between from to)	[cost: O((to - from + 1)*sqrt(N))]
;;	(this-or-next-prime n)		[cost: O(sqrt(N))]
;;	(this-or-prev-prime n)		[cost: O(sqrt(N))]
;;
;; The modest collection of functions here is likely to grow, and
;; perhaps may even be improved algorithmically.  The core of most of
;; these functions is the primality test, (prime-p N), whose running
;; time is O(sqrt(N)), which becomes excessive for large N.  Note that
;; sqrt(N) == 2^{(lg N)/2}, where lg N, the base-2 logarithm of N, is
;; the number of bits in N.  Thus O(sqrt(N)) means O(2^(bits in N)),
;; or O(10^(digits in N)).  That is, the running time increases
;; EXPONENTIALLY in the number of digits of N.
;;
;; Because knowledge of the cost of these functions may be critical to
;; the caller, each function's documentation string ends with a
;; bracketed cost estimate as a final paragraph.
;;
;; Faster algorithms capable of dealing with larger integers are
;; known.  For example, Maple V Release 5 (1997) implements a
;; probabilistic function, isprime(n), that is
;;
;;	``very probably'' prime - see Knuth ``The Art of Computer
;;	Programming'', Vol 2, 2nd edition, Section 4.5.4, Algorithm P
;;	for a reference and H. Reisel, ``Prime numbers and computer
;;	methods for factorization''. No counter example is known and
;;	it has been conjectured that such a counter example must be
;;	hundreds of digits long.
;;
;; Robert Sedgewick also promises a fast prime test in Part 5 of his
;; book ``Algorithms in C'', not yet published at the time of writing
;; this in March 1999.
;;
;; Three algorithms for probabilistic primality tests for large
;; numbers are discussed in Bruce Schneier, ``Applied Cryptography'',
;; (Wiley, 1994, ISBN 0-471-59756-2), pp. 213--216.
