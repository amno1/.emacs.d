;;; Commentary:

;; This replaces Elisp's `read' function, which is implemented in C,
;; with one implemented in Elisp which supports customizable syntax.
;; The way it does this is quite unorthodox -- it implements a rather
;; complete Elisp reader, but we do fall back to the original reader
;; for certain cases (like literal strings, characters, and other
;; syntax which the original reader supports but appears to be
;; internal to Emacs itself, such as byte-compiled code).
;;
;; It works nicely, if a bit slow.  To make it much faster you should
;; byte-compile this file:
;;
;;    emacs --batch --eval '(byte-compile-file "elisp-reader.el")'
;;
;; After loading this file, everything you eval with C-M-x in an Emacs
;; Lisp buffer, or via M-: or via M-x `eval-region' or in the REPL,
;; and even .el files loaded with `load', will be fed into our reader,
;; which will produce the actual AST to be evaluated.
;;
;; REGEXPS, PEOPLE!
;; ----------------
;;
;; One syntax extension it has built-in is for "literal regexps".  For
;; example, in the Elisp REPL (M-x `ielm'):
;;
;;     ELISP> #/(foo|bar)/
;;     "\\(foo\\|bar\\)"
;;
;; You get back a string with the Elisp regexp, nicely backslashed by
;; the rules that everybody and their uncle hate.  More examples:
;;
;;     ELISP> #/foo\nbar/
;;     "foo\nbar"             ;; literal newline
;;     ELISP> #/foo\(bar\)/
;;     "foo(bar)"             ;; match literal parens
;;     ELISP> #/\.elc$/
;;     "\\.elc$"              ;; a single \ to quote the dot
;;
;; Note that these are still Emacs (not Perl) regexes, with this small
;; twist: (1) grouping characters need not be backslashed and (2) you
;; write the regexp "literally", as opposed to inside a string, so you
;; don't need a ridiculous number of backslashes and guesswork to get
;; it right.  See `er-read-regexp'.
;;
;; DEFINING CUSTOM READER SYNTAX
;; -----------------------------
;;
;; Example of defining custom syntax (note this function uses
;; `er-read-list', which see, to get a list of Lisp datums):
;;
;;     (def-reader-syntax ?{
;;         (lambda (in ch)
;;           (let ((list (er-read-list in ?} t)))
;;             `(list ,@(cl-loop for (key val) on list by #'cddr
;;                               collect `(cons ,key ,val))))))
;;
;; and now you can type into the REPL:
;;
;;     ELISP> { :foo 1 :bar "string" :baz (+ 2 3) }
;;     ((:foo . 1)
;;      (:bar . "string")
;;      (:baz . 5))
;;
;; That's a less parenthesized way to write an alist.  Just an
;; example, it's not that I'd recommend that.  In fact, the famous
;; words come to mind: "if you ever actually do this, then.. WAT!"
;;
;; The problem with writing your own syntax extensions is that for the
;; time being, they're GLOBAL.  That's even worse than unprefixed
;; global variables.  Until we figure out how to/and implement
;; something similar to Common Lisp's "named-readtables" [1], YOU
;; SHOULD NOT USE THIS PACKAGE, except perhaps for the regexp syntax.
;;
;; [1] https://common-lisp.net/project/named-readtables/
;;
;; FILE-LOCAL SYMBOLS
;; ------------------
;;
;; A `local' macro is provided which allows you to declare a list of
;; names to be kept "internal" to the current file.  Example:
;;
;;     (local "my-package" ("foo" "bar"))
;;
;; After this declaration, you can use freely foo and bar in the
;; current file:
;;
;;     (defun foo () ...)
;;     (defvar bar ...)
;;
;; In other files, or in the REPL, they are accessible as
;; my-package-foo and my-package-bar.  But if you place the same
;; `local' declaration in another file, they'd be auto-prefixed as
;; well so you can refer to them just as foo and bar.  This is a poor
;; man's package system.
;;
;; See the docstring of `local' for more information.
;;
;; Another idea I was thinking about (did not do it but it's trivial)
;; is to support some special character, say $ — if some symbol is
;; prefixed with $ then make sure it's "local" by default (by giving
;; it some name that can't be easily accessed from other file).  That
;; would make it possible for two different libraries to use a symbol
;; named $foo without conflict.

;;; Code:

(defvar *er-orig-read* (symbol-function #'read)
  "Remember the original `read' function, because we'll have to
use it in some situations that can't be handled from Lisp code.")

(defvar *er-macro-chars* (make-hash-table :test 'eq)
  "Custom read functions.  A hash that maps character to a
function of two arguments, stream (as a function) and character.
This function should return the AST that has been read.  See
usage of `def-reader-syntax' later on.")

(defvar *er-read-filename* nil
  "This dynamic variable will be bound by our read functions
while parsing is in progress.  It'll contain the value of
`load-file-name', or the name of the current buffer if it doesn't
have an associated file.")

(defun er-make-stream (in)
  "Given an input stream (which can be a buffer, a marker, a
string, a function, or t or nil--see Elisp docs) this returns the
stream as a function of one optional argument.  When called with
no arguments, this function should return the next character from
the stream.  When called with a non-nil argument (character),
this function should arrange that character to be returned on
next invokation with no arguments.

The Elisp docs aren't entirely clear about this, but the closures
returned by this function will be able to push back multiple
characters.  Also, when the input argument is a string, the
produced function will support a keyword :pos argument, which
when passed it will return the current (zero-based) position of
the stream.  Example:

  (let ((stream (er-make-stream \"foo\")))
    (message \"%c%c\" (funcall stream) (funcall stream))  ;; fo
    (message \"%d\" (funcall stream :pos)))               ;; 2

This helps us implement `read-from-string', which has to return
the position of the stream."
