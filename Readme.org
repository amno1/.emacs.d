My current minimal and very fast Emacs setup based on my new [[https://github.com/amno1/emacs-init-generator][init file generator]].

If anyone would like to try it, I hope all needed files are included in 'lisp'
folder.

To install it, backup your old setup, clone this repo and open file
init.org in Emacs and let it evaluate the startup code. Run M-x
generate-init-files and point your Emacs to this directory (if you don't wish to
keep it in your home or .config folder).
