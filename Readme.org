My current minimal and very fast Emacs setup based on my new [[https://github.com/amno1/emacs-init-generator][init file generator]].

If anyone would like to try it, I would be glad to hear if and how it works,
especially if you find bugs with the setup (they are :-)).

To install it, backup your old files, clone this repo and open file
init.org in Emacs and let it evaluate the startup code.

Then run:

M-x install-packages     <-- to install needed packages 

M-x generate-init-files  <-- generate setup

M-x install-init-files   <-- this will remove quickstart files and compile init file
